Open reimplementation of Ingenic's closed TX-ISP kernel driver (`tx-isp-<soc>.ko`) for
T10, T20, T21, T23, T30, T31, T40 and T41. The goal is behavioural equivalence with the
OEM driver: same ioctl and `libimp` ABI, same register sequencing, same image behaviour,
with cleaner unload/reload, checked inputs and less memory.

It works with Ingenic's unmodified `libimp.so` and with the open replacement
[OpenIMP](https://github.com/Lu-Fi/openimp). Open stack = open-tx-isp + OpenIMP + a streamer
([timps](https://github.com/Lu-Fi/timps)). This fork tracks
[opensensor/open-tx-isp](https://github.com/opensensor/open-tx-isp).

This is a reverse-engineering and compatibility effort, not a greenfield pipeline: OEM binary
analysis, `libimp` ABI work and recovery of tuning data.

## Status

State of the release candidate (`claude/agg-28` on top of `next`, 2026-10-06 evening). "Fully open" = open driver, OpenIMP and streamer run from a flashed image. Release plan: `next` goes to `aperto` (fast-forward) after the long soak and is tagged `vYYYY.MM.DD`; the first release covers T10 (not re-tested on the open stack today), T20, T21, T23 and T31; T41 is not part of it.

| SoC | Status |
|---|---|
| T10 | Fully open; day/night, reload (5 cycles) and boot guard verified. Image controls partly documented. Module 731 KB. **Not re-tested** on 2026-10-06 (shares the T20 firmware base). |
| T20 | Fully open; 1 h 44 min soak without errors, 10x stop/start and reload without an oops, `rmmod` during streaming refused. Module 736 KB. apitest of the release candidate: 212 PASS / 0 FAIL on two cameras. |
| T21 | First open bring-up, now fully open; AE/ADR/defog/AWB lifted from the vendor module. Module 452 KB (vendor 616). `SetBrightness` acts and sepia works (beyond vendor). apitest of the release candidate: 228 PASS / 0 FAIL on two cameras. |
| T23 | Fully open (native encoder in OpenIMP); module 622 KB (vendor 857); vendor AE default. Frequent Helix frame drops fixed (residual interrupt, kernel patch merged upstream); stock-like release defaults, MSCA scratch buffer, AF statistics on by default (see "T23 module parameters"). Open: **a FrameSource crop change stops the pipeline (under investigation, release blocker)**, a rare single Helix encode error (errno 5), no real WDR. |
| T30 | Builds against a real T30 kernel; earlier bring-up on hardware. Not exercised in the latest campaign. |
| T31 | Reference SoC; SC2336, GC2053, SC301IOT; 2 h 53 min soak without errors; module 711 KB (vendor 829). `SetFrameDrop` with the stock semantics. Open: **H.264 stalls after the JPEG channel is torn down (under investigation, release blocker)**. |
| T40 | Device-tested earlier (T40XP/GC4653); statistics restart stability is a known limitation. Not in the latest campaign. |
| T41 | **Not part of the first release (experimental).** Fully open from a flashed image (H.264, H.265); reload verified (10/10); module 80 KB smaller than before. Open: MSCA channel 1 scaling registers are staged (fix in branch `claude/t41-ch1-fix`, not merged), an output restart can hang the SoC, 38 tuning IDs missing, flip, night column noise. |

## T23 module parameters (release candidate defaults)

Defaults of `tx-isp-t23.ko` in the release candidate. The switches are `0644` module parameters (changeable at run time through `/sys/module/tx_isp_t23/parameters/`) except where noted; the stock-like set is the one that ran 7 h overnight plus many streamer restarts. Parameters marked "debug" exist for bisecting and are not needed in normal operation.

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `chan_stop_keep_input` | 1 | Keep the input (CSI, sensor, VIC, TISP core) running after the last frame channel STREAMOFF while the ISP is streaming, as stock does; an on-demand wake then restarts no hardware. 0 stops the input with the last channel (debug; hangs together with `msca_fifo_rearm=1`) |
| `msca_keep_enabled` | 2 | What STREAMOFF does with the MSCA output enable bit: 0 clear, 1 keep when the input stops too, 2 always keep (stock style) |
| `msca_fifo_rearm` | 0 | 1 clears and refills a stopped channel's MSCA address FIFO at STREAMON (debug; stock never does) |
| `msca_flip_skip_noop` | 1 | No MSCA update request for unchanged mirror/flip bits |
| `msca_restart_skip` | 1 | No MSCA reload on STREAMON of a still-enabled output with unchanged geometry |
| `msca_session_release` | 1 | An ISP STREAMON with the input stopped switches off MSCA outputs left enabled and clears their FIFOs |
| `msca_scratch` | 1 | STREAMOFF parks a kept MSCA output on a scratch area at the tail of the ISP buffer (900 KiB at 720p), QBUFs of a parked channel are held until STREAMON, the input waits until the scratch address was consumed. Read-only counters `msca_scratch_parks`, `_frames`, `_deferred`, `_skips`, `_settle_timeouts`, `_settle_ticks_max`. 0 = off (first thing to try if a stop/start hangs) |
| `chan_stop_drain` | 21 | STREAMOFF waits up to N x 10 ms until the channel's queued buffers have left the hardware (stock: 21); 0 = no wait. Counters `chan_drain_waits`, `chan_drain_timeouts`, `chan_drain_ticks_max` |
| `qbuf_cache_inv` | 1 | QBUF invalidates the buffer's cache lines before its addresses reach the FIFO (as stock); 0 = off (debug) |
| `source_af` | 1 (read-only) | AF statistics chain of the stock module: AF block, AF interrupt and the AF getters/setters. 0 = AF off and the controls unrouted. No measurable CPU or interrupt cost |
| `source_ae_oem` | 1 (read-only) | Lifted vendor AE (default since 2026-10-03) |
| `crumbs` | 0 | Hang step markers in a reserved page (1 = rmem page after the MDNS buffer, 2 = page at `crumb_addr`); only for hang analysis |
| `t23_runtime_trace` | 0 | 1 enables informational driver logging |
| `isp_clk`, `isp_clka` | 153000000, 416000000 (load time only) | ISP core and AXI clocks in Hz; since the candidate they really reach the hardware (before, the activation path read the wrong clock-table slot) |

## Better than the vendor driver

- Reload and stop: 10 stop/start and rmmod/insmod cycles without an oops on T20/T21/T23/T31/T41 (T10: 5 cycles).
- T20/T10 give back about 8 MB RAM (unused 8 MiB V4L2 frame pool off by default); on a T20 the open stack measured 10.5 % streamer CPU against 25.2 % with the vendor stack, snapshots 0.20 s against 0.45 s.
- Smaller modules than the vendor on T21, T23 and T31.
- Checked inputs (all user copies, QBUF window, bounded waits), sensor module pinned while streaming.
- T21 controls and noise reduction act (the vendor ignores them), T10/T20 noise-reduction strength acts.
- Shortfall logging with a concrete parameter value when reserved memory is too small.

## Build

Out-of-tree kernel modules, built against a Thingino buildroot output (toolchain and vendor
kernel tree, Linux 3.10.14 for T10-T31, 4.4.94 for T40/T41). The helper picks the SoC with `SOC`:

```sh
SOC=t31 ./build_local.sh          # t10 t20 t21 t23 t30 t31 t40 t41
TH=/path/to/thingino-firmware SOC=t23 ./build_local.sh
```

`TH`, `ROOT`, `KDIR`, `CROSS` and `ARCH` can be overridden (see the comments in `build_local.sh`).
It builds `driver/<soc>/` into `tx-isp-<soc>.ko` plus the diagnostic `driver/tx_isp_trace.ko`; when no
module for the SoC was built locally the result is a compile baseline only. The T20 driver expects the
`external/ingenic-sdk` submodule (`git submodule update --init`). Host tests for kernel-independent
primitives: `make -C tests check`.

## Integration in Thingino

The packages `open-tx-isp` (this driver) and `openimp` (userspace) are in the upstream
[thingino-firmware](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware) branch `aperto`
([#1756](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1756)), selected with
`BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_ISP_OPEN` (menu "ISP stack") and pinned by commit SHA to the `next` branches
of the Lu-Fi forks. The module is installed as `tx-isp-<soc>.ko` and replaces the proprietary one;
SDK sensor, audio and AVPU modules stay. The kernel VPU/rmem stability patches
([#1748](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1748),
[#1752](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1752)) are merged there. The optional
boot guard `BR2_PACKAGE_THINGINO_ISP_GUARD` ([#1749](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1749),
default off; `isp_open=auto|manual|off`) skips the ISP/sensor modules after an unstable load so a bad
driver cannot boot-loop the camera. Once the first date tag exists on `aperto`, thingino's `aperto` branch will pin that tag instead of a SHA.

## Branches and releases

- `main`: fork default branch, not the tested stack.
- `next`: tested integration branch; everything on it was flashed and checked on cameras.
- `aperto`: release branch; fast-forward only from `next` after a clean soak (planned, not created yet; the first tag follows after the 24 h soak that started 2026-10-04). It carries the date tags, and thingino's `aperto` branch pins the tag.
- Tags `vYYYY.MM.DD` on `aperto` (planned).
- Work happens on `claude/<topic>` branches, merged into `next` after device tests.
