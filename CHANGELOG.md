# Changelog (open-tx-isp)

Condensed from the open-stack campaign changelog; only open-tx-isp (kernel driver) changes.
Newest first, grouped by date. Everything listed was device-tested on the SoC named unless
marked otherwise. Release tags `vYYYY.MM.DD` on the `aperto` branch are planned (the first one after the 24 h soak that started 2026-10-04); until then dates are the reference. Branch names are historic: the topic branches were merged into `next` and deleted.

## 2026-10-05

- Pending (branch `claude/t23-af`, host- and emulator-tested only, no device test yet): T23 AF statistics chain from the stock module, off by default (`source_af=1`): AF block + core interrupt bit 31, focus values, GetAfHist/SetAfHist, Get/SetAfWeight, GetAFMetrices, GetAfZone (controls 0x8000042/43/44/46). Shares the data handling of the T31 chain; verified identical to the stock `tx-isp-t23.ko` in the MIPS emulator (`driver/t23/audit/af_emu.py`).
- Pending (branch `claude/t20-fw-optimize`, host-tested only, device test open): the recovered T20/T10 firmware unit builds at `-Os` like the rest of the module (T20 module text 399 to 245 KB, `.ko` 589 to 409 KB; T10 the same). Spots that only worked at `-O0` fixed against the OEM disassembly (dropped call arguments, a partition-LUT walk past its object, command-interface state on the stack, a stack buffer one word short, an inline-asm tail jump, a missing return). New host harness `tests/t20_fw` runs the firmware at `-O0`/`-Os`/`-O2` through init, 239 frames, API sweeps and day/night tuning switches and requires identical register traces and state. `TX_ISP_FW_O0=1` restores the `-O0` build for A/B tests.

## 2026-10-04

- thingino: `open-tx-isp` is part of upstream `aperto` ([#1756](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/pull/1756)), pinned to this fork's `next`; the kernel VPU/rmem patches (#1748, #1752) and the optional boot guard (#1749) are merged there. All test cameras run `aperto` images (30/30 snapshots, 0 oops, 0 VPU errors).
- Pending (on branches, not yet in `next`, soak first): T23 root cause of the snapshot 503 on a second channel (stale MSCA address FIFOs after a stream stop, the vendor clears them on STREAMOFF; fix clears and re-arms them at STREAMON, 260 cold-start cycles without a failure) and the T23 log switch (`t23_runtime_trace`, informational output off by default, boot log 522 to 78 lines, errors stay visible).
- T41: AE compensation, gain/exposure caps and 2D/3D noise reduction reach the ISP; unimplemented tuning IDs are refused.
- T20/T10: the unused 8 MiB V4L2-MMAP frame pool is off by default (`isp_mmap_pool_kb=0`, parameter kept): about +8 MB free RAM (T20 MemFree 46.7 to 55 MB, T10 1.9 to ~9.7 MB); only the recovered firmware unit stays `-O0` (-140 KB).
- Shortfall logging: when reserved memory is too small the driver logs once with have/need/missing and a concrete value (`isp_mmap_pool_kb`, `ispmem`).
- Hardening: T31 proc writes bounded, VIC stop busy-wait bounded (~10 ms), AE handle wait with 2 s timeout; T20/T10 IRQ registered before its data was published (oops on early interrupt) fixed.
- T20 AE after a streamer restart: sensor exposure cache invalidated on every sensor sync and AE state reset like on a fresh load (5/5 restarts converge).
- Sensor module pin fixed on T21/T31/T41 (the sensor driver was registered with the ISP module as owner): `rmmod` of a sensor during streaming is refused, no more use-after-free.
- T23: white-balance jump to ~10000 K with the vendor AE fixed (black level rewritten after stream start).
- T41: unload, flip, BCSH and isp-m0 fixes merged into `next`; module 80 KB smaller; three clean reloads.
- `next` branch created; it tracks the tested aggregate (fast-forward only).

## 2026-10-03

- Module size: T23 1,047 to 622 KB (vendor 857), T31 859 to 711 KB (vendor 829), T21 760 to 452 KB (vendor 616), T20 775 to 736 KB, T10 770 to 731 KB.
- T41: module reload root cause fixed (a decompiled tuning-node helper overwrote `.bss`, 10/10 reload cycles clean); picture controls, `isp-m0` in vendor layout, flip registers, sensor re-registration.
- T23: dynamic ADR and defog lifted from the vendor module (44/44 emulator cases identical); lifted vendor AE is the default; review fixes for unload use-after-free, defog allocations, front-crop overflow, ADR/AE locking; front crop on the vendor path.
- T21: `ae_it_max_us` acts (beyond vendor, kept by decision); AWB hysteresis at dusk (39 switches to 0 in 40 frames); colour-temperature updates only above 50 K change; lifted AWB 1.41x to 0.95x of vendor instructions.
- T10/T20: `ae_it_max_us` limits the AE; Sinter/Temper strength acts; CCM/LSC readable in `isp-m0`; T10 reload safe (5 cycles, build for the wrong kernel tree refused); T10 duplicate `isp_printf` export fixed.
- T10: sub-stream and diagonal drift fixed in the lifted firmware shared with T20.
- Hardening: QBUF buffers must lie in the rmem window (`qbuf_guard=0` disables); sensor module pinned while the ISP is open; AVPU review fixes (minor-number leak, use-after-free on unbind, flush range).
- T31: privacy mask implemented like the vendor (400/400 random sequences register-identical); scene mode and colour effects on T23/T31; tuning stubs replaced (black level, colour matrix presets, front crop, scaler level).
- T30 readiness without hardware: builds for a real T30 kernel, missing `isp_printf` export fixed.
- Kernel patches 0099/0100/0101 for the soc_vpu driver and rmem flush ioctl (sleeping wait, immediate error interrupt, validated flush range, statistics registers readable for the vendor T20 rate controller).

## 2026-10-02

- Robustness: T23 10 stop/start and reload cycles without an oops, two out-of-bounds writes fixed, `.bss` 434 to 180 KB; T20 `rmmod` while streaming refused, 53 user copies checked; T31 vmalloc leak (252 KB per cycle) fixed; T21 reload oops root cause (statistics DMA into freed buffers) fixed.
- Independent review: deadlock between sensor unload and `/proc/jz/sensor/*`, orphan sensor slots, T21 open/release counting.
- T21: white balance, CT detection and CT-driven CCM/LSC lifted from the vendor module (10/10 scenes register-identical); event callbacks with IRQs off like the vendor.
- T23: gain index for gain-driven blocks was linear instead of log2; sharpen parameters loaded from the active IQ bank; exposure kept across stream restarts; failed stream start and reload fixed (statistics DMA freed while active); vendor AE chain behind `source_ae_oem`.
- T20: vertical flip chroma overrun (pink band) and sharpness fixed; vendor AWB chain behind `t20_simple_awb=0` after fixing decompilation errors.
- T10 integrated: the NVPU wrote 21 KB/10 KB past each reference plane, fixed; day/night panic from a zeroed FSM manager pointer fixed.

## 2026-09-30 to 2026-10-01 (campaign start)

- T31: lifecycle hardening (locking around frame-channel ioctls, STREAMOFF races, last-close use-after-free), `O_NONBLOCK` DQBUF, tuning gaps closed (RGB coefficients, AE ROI, SensorAttr, isp-w02 VIC counters, per-frame WaitFrame).
- T23: live exposure readback and vendor-format `isp-m0`; day-to-night oops fixed; ~45 control IDs that silently returned success are wired or rejected; night purple fixed; module 1,598 to 1,095 KB.
- T20: vendor-format `isp-m0`, correct AE exposure readback, oops on timps stop/restart fixed (20 clean cycles), max analog gain applied by the AE.
- T21 (first open bring-up): exposure readback, unreachable controls, night flicker (stock AE lifted instruction by instruction), noise, night mono, colour blotches, overexposure, control dispatchers lifted from the vendor module.
